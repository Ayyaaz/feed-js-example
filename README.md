Passle JavaScript feed example
==================

This solution is an example of how the Passle feed can be used in a JavaScript
and Html application. To see the example feed, simply open the file in a 
browser.

Please note: 

  1. You'll need to replace the shortcode in the JavaScript `init` method with the shortcode of the Passle you are trying to display
> You can get this from the settings page of your Passle.
  2. The container `div` for the feed must have a class of `passle-container`
  3. The `passle-feed-*.min.js` script link needs `id="passle-script-container"` on the script tag
